## Hotkeys - advise to change them to : 

- Split pane, split down : ```ctrl + h (from horizontal)```
- Split pane, split right : ctrl + v (from Vertical) 
- New tab : ctrl + t
- Close pane : ctrl + w
# Use "Alt" and go dropdown and open new terminal, it will open splitting with current screen. 
- Create horizontal pane : alt + shift + minus: 
- Create verticial pane : alt + shift + plus -- better to change to alt + shift + | (the pipe is more intuitive for vertical)
