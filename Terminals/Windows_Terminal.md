## Hotkeys - advise to change them to : 

- Split pane, split down : ```alt + shift + - (from horizontal)```
- Split pane, split right : ```alt + shift + | (from Vertical)```
- New tab : ```ctrl + t```
- Close pane :```ctrl + w```
### Use "Alt" and go dropdown and open new terminal, it will open splitting with current screen. 
- Create horizontal pane : ```alt + shift + minus``` 
- Create verticial pane : ```alt + shift + plus``` better to change to ```alt + shift + |``` (the pipe is more intuitive for vertical)
